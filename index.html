                  <h3>ID Reader</h3>

                  <h1>Purpose</h1>
                  <p>
                      The purpose of the ID Reader project is to create a more secure, agile and GDPR-compliant
                      way to register people entering and exiting a sensitive room. The solution should also meet
                      requirements that can be set according to ISO standards and serve as a proof of concept for
                      how simple technology like a Raspberry Pi can be used in a security and logging context.
                  </p>

                  <h1>Problem</h1>
                  <p>
                    Currently, a manual system is used where people entering and exiting a specific room must
                    write down their name and time of entry and exit on a physical piece of paper. This poses
                    several problems:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Time-consuming: It takes time to manually fill in the information each time.</li>
                    <li>Lack of security: The information is easily accessible to unauthorized people and can be manipulated or stolen.</li>
                    <li>Not GDPR-safe: Personal data is stored openly and can be read by others.</li>
                    <li>Limited traceability and no automation: It is difficult to perform analysis or control access afterwards.</li>
                    <li>Not ISO compliant: The current system does not meet the requirements for security and traceability.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h1>Solution</h1>
                  <p>
                    The solution is a digital system where the user places their ID card in a drawer. A camera
                    connected to a Raspberry Pi takes a picture of the card. When the user presses a button,
                    a Python program is activated that reads the name using image processing/OCR. The information
                    is sent via MQTT to another Raspberry Pi that stores the name along with a timestamp in a SQL database.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Automates the process and saves time.</li>
                    <li>Protects information by storing it digitally instead of physically.</li>
                    <li>Enables traceability with precise logging of entry and exit.</li>
                    <li>Can be expanded for additional security features (e.g. door control, authentication).</li>
                    <li>Better complies with GDPR by minimizing manual handling of personal data.</li>
                    <li>Can be adapted to meet ISO requirements for security and traceability.</li>

                  <h3>Modern Data Stack Implementation for Job Ads Analytics</h3>

                  <h1>Purpose</h1>
                  <p>
                    The project aims to implement the modern data stack to solve a real-world problem.
                    In addition to using a certain number of technologies, there is a focus on working together in a data team.
                    This includes both agile development and being able to use git and github in a team.
                  </p>

                  <h1>Problem</h1>
                  <p>
                    The company Arbetskollen AB wants to build a data pipeline that serves a dashboard to visualize statistics for job advertisements. 
                    This could be a dimension to help future students find the right field to study in or for job seekers to more easily navigate between different professions.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h1>Solution</h1>
                  <p>
                    The final solution is a robust data pipeline and reporting system built to ingest, transform, and visualize job advertisement data from Arbetsförmedlingens API. 
                    The data modeling is based on a star schema, chosen for its simplicity and efficiency in supporting analytical queries and reporting.
                    Data flows through a well-structured data architecture with three layers:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Staging layer (schema: staging), Stores raw API data.</li>
                      <li>Transformation layer (schema: warehouse), Cleans and processes data using DBT.</li>
                      <li>resentation layer (schema: marts), Contains aggregated and refined data ready for reporting and visualization.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The pipeline uses Python and DLT to fetch and load data into Snowflake, while DBT performs advanced transformations and metric calculations. 
                    The final data is visualized using a Streamlit dashboard, which includes a home screen and navigation menu for improved user experience.
                    This architecture ensures clean, reliable, and easily accessible data for stakeholders, with efficient performance and maintainability.

                  <p> 
                    The purpose of this Power BI dashboard is to empower decision-makers with real-time, data-driven insights 
                    into company sales performance by integrating and visualizing sales data from a centralized SQL database.
                  </p>

                  <h1>Problem</h1>
                  <p>
                    The company has a large amount of sales data stored in CSV files that need to be processed and loaded into a SQL database for analysis and reporting.
                    The current manual process is time-consuming and error-prone, leading to delays in data availability and potential inaccuracies in reporting.
                  </p>
                  <h1>Solution</h1>
                  <p>
                    To address the inefficiencies and risks associated with manually processing large volumes of sales data from CSV files, 
                    I implemented an automated data pipeline that extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) the data into a SQL database using Python.
                    Once the data is available in SQL, it is connected to Power BI for real-time dashboards and interactive reporting.
                    Power BI will allow stakeholders to:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Visualize sales trends and patterns over time.</li>
                      <li>Analyze sales performance by product, region, and sales representative.</li>
                      <li>Identify top-performing products and areas for improvement.</li>
                      <li>Make data-driven decisions to optimize sales strategies and increase revenue.</li>
                    </ul>

                    The purpose of the project is to modernize DataVision Analytics AB's data platform to enable the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). 
                    The goal is to analyze large amounts of data from customer interactions, transactions and market research. 
                    Which leads to more advanced data analysis that will help customer understanding, optimized sales and better customer experience.
                  </p>
                  <h1>Problem</h1>
                  <p>
                    DataVision Analytics AB wants to update its data system so that it can think smarter using AI and Machine Learning. 
                    They want to learn more about what customers like and how they shop, so they can sell more and make their customers happier. 
                    The company has tons of information about its customers from purchases, conversations, and surveys. 
                    They plan to use a powerful data system called Microsoft Azure to make this possible.
                  </p>
                  <h1>Solution</h1>
                  <p>
                    Using Azure Data Factory, the company will collect and organize data from:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Customer interactions (e.g., website visits, emails, support chats)</li>
                      <li>Transactions (in-store and online purchases)</li>
                      <li>arket research (surveys, social media, external reports)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p></p>
                    Data Storage:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Data Lake, stores all types of data, even unstructured (e.g., text, images, audio).</li>
                      <li>Data Warehouse, a structured database used for fast and reliable data analysis.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p></p>
                    The company will use ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) methods to:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Combine and clean data from different systems.</li>
                      <li>Ensure consistency and accuracy.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p></p>
                    Using Azure Machine Learning Studio, the company will:
                    <ul>  
                      <li>Train ML models with historical data (customer behavior, purchases, etc.)</li>
                      <li>Predict future events like Which products will sell well and which customers may stop buying.</li>
                      <li>Continuously update models with new data to keep them accurate</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p></p>

              Hi, I'm Attapon Sayod, and I'm 22 years old (turning 23 this October). 
              Originally from Thailand, I moved to Sweden when I was four, so I've essentially grown up here. 
              The past years I've studied to become a Data Engineer at Stockholms Tekniska Institut, where I learned a lot about data processing, analysis, and visualization.
              Outside of my professional aspirations, I'm deeply interested in fitness, particularly Muay Thai and MMA, and I enjoy watching UFC.
