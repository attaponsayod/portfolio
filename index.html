                  <h3>ID Reader</h3>

                  <h1>Purpose</h1>
                  <p>
                      The purpose of the ID Reader project is to create a more secure, agile and GDPR-compliant
                      way to register people entering and exiting a sensitive room. The solution should also meet
                      requirements that can be set according to ISO standards and serve as a proof of concept for
                      how simple technology like a Raspberry Pi can be used in a security and logging context.
                  </p>

                  <h1>Problem</h1>
                  <p>
                    Currently, a manual system is used where people entering and exiting a specific room must
                    write down their name and time of entry and exit on a physical piece of paper. This poses
                    several problems:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Time-consuming: It takes time to manually fill in the information each time.</li>
                    <li>Lack of security: The information is easily accessible to unauthorized people and can be manipulated or stolen.</li>
                    <li>Not GDPR-safe: Personal data is stored openly and can be read by others.</li>
                    <li>Limited traceability and no automation: It is difficult to perform analysis or control access afterwards.</li>
                    <li>Not ISO compliant: The current system does not meet the requirements for security and traceability.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h1>Solution</h1>
                  <p>
                    The solution is a digital system where the user places their ID card in a drawer. A camera
                    connected to a Raspberry Pi takes a picture of the card. When the user presses a button,
                    a Python program is activated that reads the name using image processing/OCR. The information
                    is sent via MQTT to another Raspberry Pi that stores the name along with a timestamp in a SQL database.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Automates the process and saves time.</li>
                    <li>Protects information by storing it digitally instead of physically.</li>
                    <li>Enables traceability with precise logging of entry and exit.</li>
                    <li>Can be expanded for additional security features (e.g. door control, authentication).</li>
                    <li>Better complies with GDPR by minimizing manual handling of personal data.</li>
                    <li>Can be adapted to meet ISO requirements for security and traceability.</li>

                  <h3>Modern Data Stack Implementation for Job Ads Analytics</h3>

                  <h1>Purpose</h1>
                  <p>
                    The project aims to implement the modern data stack to solve a real-world problem.
                    In addition to using a certain number of technologies, there is a focus on working together in a data team.
                    This includes both agile development and being able to use git and github in a team.
                  </p>

                  <h1>Problem</h1>
                  <p>
                    The company Arbetskollen AB wants to build a data pipeline that serves a dashboard to visualize statistics for job advertisements. 
                    This could be a dimension to help future students find the right field to study in or for job seekers to more easily navigate between different professions.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h1>Solution</h1>
                  <p>
                    The final solution is a robust data pipeline and reporting system built to ingest, transform, and visualize job advertisement data from Arbetsf√∂rmedlingens API. 
                    The data modeling is based on a star schema, chosen for its simplicity and efficiency in supporting analytical queries and reporting.
                    Data flows through a well-structured data architecture with three layers:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Staging layer (schema: staging), Stores raw API data.</li>
                      <li>Transformation layer (schema: warehouse), Cleans and processes data using DBT.</li>
                      <li>resentation layer (schema: marts), Contains aggregated and refined data ready for reporting and visualization.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The pipeline uses Python and DLT to fetch and load data into Snowflake, while DBT performs advanced transformations and metric calculations. 
                    The final data is visualized using a Streamlit dashboard, which includes a home screen and navigation menu for improved user experience.
                    This architecture ensures clean, reliable, and easily accessible data for stakeholders, with efficient performance and maintainability.

              Hi, I'm Attapon Sayod, and I'm 22 years old (turning 23 this October). 
              Originally from Thailand, I moved to Sweden when I was four, so I've essentially grown up here. 
              I relocated to Stockholm from Arboga to pursue my passion for data engineering. 
              Outside of my professional aspirations, I'm deeply interested in fitness, particularly Muay Thai and MMA, and I enjoy watching UFC.
